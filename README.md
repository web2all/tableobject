# Web2All table

This `web2all/table` package requires the `web2all/framework` ([https://github.com/web2all/framework](https://github.com/web2all/framework)). It used to be proprietary software but now it has been released to the public domain under a MIT license.

This pacckage is no longer actively maintained. Most likely it is only of interest if you own software created by Web2All B.V. which was built using table classes.

## What does it do ##

Define table classes (models) for your database tables extending the `Web2All_Table_Object` class (or implementing `Web2All_Table_ObjectTrait`) and easily retrieve your data from the database using your models (CRUD).

Each table class defines a mapping between object properties and database fields. The table classes can also be automatically generated from a database table.

No need to write database queries. Retrieve lists using the ObjectList class and friends.
